# Artivact's Items

## Introduction

The core piece of information in Artivact are the collection items.

Every item in the collection has its own page containing details and media files of the item.

Items can be searched by widgets and thus be integrated into other pages.
This enables flexible item selection and page orchestration to manage your collection.

Items are managed using the item settings button:

The menu offers different options to manage items:
