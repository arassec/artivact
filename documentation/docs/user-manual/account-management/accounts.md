# Artivact's Account Management <Badge type="warning" text="server"/>

## Accounts

Artivact supports accounts to collaborate on collection management.
Account management can be opened by clicking the button in the top navigation:
![account-settings-button](../introduction/assets/about/account-settings-button.png)

Users are able to manage their own account settings, especially the password, by opening the ``Account`` page.
Administrators can manage all system accounts by opening the ``Accounts`` page.

Accounts required at least a ``username`` and ``password`` to be able to log in.

Additionally, the following information can be provided:

- E-Mail: An optional e-mail address of the user which is currently only saved in the system.
- The user's assigned roles as described below.


## Roles

There are two roles available, that increase a user's rights in the application:

- User:
    - Users have the right to create and edit items and pages in Artivact.
- Administrator:
  - Administrators have all user rights and can additionally configure system settings and accounts.
