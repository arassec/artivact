# Item Tags

## Configuration

Tags can be defined on the tags configuration page.

They consist of a label and an optional URL.

Assigned to an item, they are shown on the [item's details page](/user-manual/item-management/item-details) and can be
used e.g. to filter items in search queries.

## Import/Export

Properties can be exported as JSON file.

The same file can then be imported by another Artivact instance on the properties configuration page.
