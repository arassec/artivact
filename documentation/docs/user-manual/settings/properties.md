# Item Properties

## Configuration

On the properties configuration page, item properties are defined and organized in categories.

The configured properties are then shown on the [item's details page](/user-manual/item-management/item-details-page).

## Import/Export

Properties can be exported as JSON file.

The same file can then be imported by another Artivact instance on the properties configuration page.
