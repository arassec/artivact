# Publish Exhibitions

## Publishing

Since exhibitions are supposed to be experienced by users in the metaverse, they must be transferred to the
virtual reality headsets.

There are currently no simple ways of publishing an exhibition.

Until they are implemented in the future, the only option is to copy the created exhibition file into the project's
artivact-vr directory and build ArtivactVR by hand.

The resulting APK will contain the exhibition, which can then be experienced by other users.
