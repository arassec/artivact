# Artivact in the Metaverse

## About

::: danger Work in progress
ArtivactVR is currently in alpha stage and under development.
:::

Virtual collection items and their 3D models still remain flat on the web.
Experiencing them in VR/AR adds a whole new dimension to them.

ArtivactVR is a VR app for mobile, virtual reality headsets. 
It is built with the open source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

There is no stable release of the app at the moment.
The documentation will be updated while the app progresses.
