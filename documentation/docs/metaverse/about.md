# Artivact in the Metaverse

## About

::: danger Work in progress
The VR app is currently in alpha stage and under heavy development.
:::

Virtual collection items and their 3D models still remain flat on the web.
Experiencing them in VR/AR adds a whole new dimension to them.

Artivact provides a VR app for mobile headsets, built with the open source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and OpenXR.

There is no release of the app at the moment. 
In order to try it out, it has to be built from source.

The documentation will be updated while the app progresses.
