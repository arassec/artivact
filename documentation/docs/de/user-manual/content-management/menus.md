# Menus

## Menu Management

You can add menus by left-clicking on the following button in the top bar:
![add-menu-button](../introduction/assets/about/add-menu-button.png)

A dialog opens, and you can configure the menu's name and restrictions, if the menu shouldn't be available to anyone:

![add-menu-modal](./assets/menus/add-menu-modal.png)

Additionally, you can provide a name and description for exports based on this menu.
Exports of menus contain all pages of the menu and their contained items with media files.

After adding the menu, it will be shown in the menu bar.
As long as there are no menu entries defined, or a page assigned to the menu, it will be shown in red and only to
administrators.

By right-clicking on the menu a context menu opens

which offers the following options:

## Menu Entries

Menus can have entries.
When adding an entry to a menu, the same dialog as the one for menus opens, and a menu entry name and restrictions can
be specified.

When right-clicking on an existing menu entry, a context menu opens
