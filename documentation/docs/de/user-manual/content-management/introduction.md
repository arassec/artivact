# Artivact's Content Management System

## Introduction

Artivact provides a basic CMS to manage your collection.

The core concepts are:

- The user defines the menu structure in the top navigation.
- Each menu entry can either directly open a page, or contain a list of menu entries.
- Menu entries each open a different page.

Pages are built using Widgets. Those are small building blocks of a page, which can e.g. show the results of an item
search or a page header.

Thus, you can individually define how you want to manage your collection.
