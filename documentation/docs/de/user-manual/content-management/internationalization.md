# Internationalization (I18N)

## Configuration

Supported locales can be configured in the [Appearance Configuration](/user-manual/settings/appearance).

A locale, to edit items and pages for, can be selected by the globe symbol:
![locale-selection-button](../introduction/assets/about/locale-selection-button.png)

When selected, all text inputs are then edited for the selected locale.

The default locale's value, which is used as fallback if the user's preferences don't match any supported locale, will
be shown to the right of the input field.
