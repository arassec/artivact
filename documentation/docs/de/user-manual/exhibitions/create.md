# Create Exhibitions

## Creation

At the moment, exhibition creation is limited.
You can provide the following information:

- **Title:** The exhibition's title as shown in ArtivactVR's exhibition overview.
- **Description:** A short description of the exhibition.

In order to add items to the exhibition, you can select previously created pages. Those will be converted into the
exhibition.

Whenever you save an exhibition's configuration, it will be (re-)created.

After creation, the exhibition data can be found as ZIP file in the project's ``exhibitions`` directory.
