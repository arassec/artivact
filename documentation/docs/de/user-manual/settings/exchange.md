## Synchronization Configuration

Two configuration options must be set in order to upload items from a local installation to a remote instance of
Artivact:

- Remote Artivact Server
    - HTTP(S) URL to the remote Artivact instance, e.g. ``https://www.example.com/``
- API Token
    - A security token (String) configured in the account settings on the remote instance. This user account will be
      used for upload.
