# Configuring the Application

## The Project Directory

Artivact stores all project data in the filesystem.
The default project directory is the directory ```.avdata``` in the user's home directory.

In order to change the project directory, you can start the application with the following parameter (Windows example):

``
Artivact.exe --artivact.project.root=C:\Artivact-Projects\sample-project
``

## Third Party Software

All used third party applications are configured within the running application. 
In order to use the tools, they have to be installed by the user first.

They can then be configured by navigating to ``Settings`` -> ``Peripherals``.
