# Artivact as Local Application

## About

Artivact can help you create and organize your collection. On the Desktop it is also able to create 3D models of your
items using third party tools for photogrammetry.

Using photogrammetry to create digital twins of real life items is a time-consuming and tedious task.
It often leads to a ton of different files and directories in the filesystem and one can lose track of the progress
easily.

The process of model creation usually involves the following steps:

- Creating lots of images of the item from different perspectives.
- Copying the images from your camera to your PC.
- Using the photos in a photogrammetry tool to create a 3D model.
- Sometimes editing the result in a model editor to finish it.
- Export the model in the desired format.

Artivact allows you to configure third party programs as well as using a camera setup connected to your PC, thus
speeding up the whole process from picture taking to model creation to export drastically.

## Features

The desktop application provides the following features:

- Flexible options to organize your collection and keep track of every virtual item.
- Easy and fast creation of 3D models by combining different tools in the process of model creation.
- Export of created items and their media files in a standard ZIP format.

## Third Party Software

Artivact itself is no photogrammetry software. It provides a frontend for different tools required in the process,
without hiding them from the user. The user remains in full control of the tools used, but gets support in handling
them.

The following software is currently supported.

### Model Creation

The following photogrammetry tools are supported by Artivact. They are started from within the program, but must be
operated by the user manually:
