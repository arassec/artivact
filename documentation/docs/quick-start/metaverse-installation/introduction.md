# Artivact in the Metaverse

## About

::: danger Work in progress
ArtivactVR is currently in alpha stage and under development.
:::

Virtual collection items and their 3D models still remain flat on the web.
Experiencing them in VR/AR adds a whole new dimension to them.

ArtivactVR is a VR app for mobile, virtual reality headsets. 
It is built with the open source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

There is no stable release of the app at the moment.
The documentation will be updated while the app progresses.

## Proof of Concept

The app has currently basic functionality to present the exhibitions created by Artivact.
Its main purpose is to demonstrate, that 3D models created by photogrammetry can be used on mobile VR headsets.

A short demo video (without sound or commentary) is available for download:
