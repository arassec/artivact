# Model Editing

## Why Edit the Model?

Photogrammetry software does not always generate accurate 3D models from captured images.
Artifacts might get generated into the resulting 3D model, which might not be wanted.

For those cases it might be useful to edit the 3D model manually with a 3D modelling tool.

Currently, Artivact has integration for the free and open-source tool Blender 3D implemented.

Details on the configuration can be found in the [User Manual](../../user-manual/settings/peripherals)

The final 3D model should be exported as GLTF/GLB file into the default folder suggested by Blender.

It can then finally be transferred to the virtual items media section and used from there on.
