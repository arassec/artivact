# Artivact as 3D-Scanner

## About

Using Artivact on your local computer can help speed up virtual item creation.
3D models for virtual items can be created using photogrammetry.
This process creates models from images taken from a real-life object.

It can be split into the following steps:

- Take multiple pictures of the object from different angles.
    - Take a picture of the object
    - Move the object by a certain degree
    - repeat until enough pictures are taken
- Copy the images from the camera to your computer
- Modify the images to support full 360Â° models (if applicable)
- Create a 3D model from the images using photogrammetry software.
- Edit the resulting model (if necessary) using 3D modelling software.

Artivact tries to automate these steps as good as possible.

Since there are plenty good tutorials online for each individual step, the following pages focus on using photogrammetry
through Artivact.
