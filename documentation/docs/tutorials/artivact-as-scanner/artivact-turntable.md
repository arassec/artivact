# Artivact Turntable

## Automatic Object Rotation

In order to speedup item creation, and since the camera can be automatically controlled, the object can be automatically
rotated by Artivact as well.

Based on other do-it-yourself 3D scanner solutions in the web, Artivact provides an automatic 3D turntable.

The parts have to be 3D printed and assembled by yourself.
It can afterward be used to rotate the object automatically between image capturing.

## Required Parts

The following parts are required to assemble the turntable.

::: tip Arduino Sketch
The Arduino Nano needs to have the following sketch
installed: [sketch_artivact-tt-v1.ino](https://github.com/arassec/artivact/blob/main/artivact-tt-v1/sketch_artivact-tt-v1/sketch_artivact-tt-v1.ino).
Please refer to the [Arduino Documentation](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/getting-started-arduino/) for
how to do this.
