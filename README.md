## About

Artivact is an application to create virtual items and manage them in collections.

It is written in Java using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and provides an
easy-to-use web-frontend based on the Quasar framework [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/).

### On the Desktop

The application's desktop variant can be used to create 3D models for virtual items using third party tools
and photogrammetry. It combines camera setups with photogrammetry and model editing to speed 3D model creation up.

The created models can be assigned to items which themselves can be categorized and organized using the application.

### On the Web

Run as a web server, virtual collections can be presented as web pages using Artivacts simple-to-use content management
system.

Items can either be created directly in the browser, or uploaded from the desktop installation.

Pages from the CMS can then be exported as virtual exhibitions, which can be experienced using ArtivactVR in the future.

### In the Metaverse

The ArtivactVR app is currently in development, created using the open source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

It will support virtual exhibitions created with the Artivact desktop or web server variants.
